\title{Perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis}
\usage{
simpliGSEA(genes, universe, annot.genes, annot.terms,
  alternative = "greater")
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{A character vector. The gene IDs of interest.}

\item{universe}{A character vector. The complete set of gene IDs used to
generate the gene IDs of interest.}

\item{annot.genes}{A character vector. The gene IDs to which \code{annot.terms}
will correspond.}

\item{annot.terms}{A character vector. The annotations corresponding to
\code{annot.genes}.}

\item{alternative}{A character string. Argument passed to \code{fisher.test}.}
}
\value{
A vector of unadjusted p-values named as the tested annotation.
}
\description{
This function simplifies gene set enrichment analysis for custom annotations.
 Do not use this function for annotations that have directed acyclic graph
 (DAG) relationships (e.g., GO). Gene set enrichment analysis performed
 using Fisher's exact test for count data. This function will automatically
 filter non-unique \code{annot.genes} and \code{annot.terms} pairs.
