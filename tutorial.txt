### Functions to assist in genomic annotations

'lift' - This function simplifies the process of "lifting over" coordinates from one genome build to another by automatically downloading the necessary .over.chain.gz file.
* object: a GRanges object
* from: the initial UCSC equivalent genome build (e.g. hg18)
* to: the target UCSC equivalent genome build (e.g. hg19)
* flatGrl: if TRUE, collapses the default GRangesList output to GRanges

'simpliGSEA' - This function simplifies gene set enrichment analysis for custom annotations. Do not use with annotations that have directed acyclic graph (DAG) relationships such as GO.
* genes: vector of gene IDs of interest
* universe: praent vector of gene IDs used to generate the gene IDs of interest
* annot.genes: a vector of genes for which one will supply annotations
* annot.terms: a vector of annotations corresponding to annot.genes

### Functions to assist in data visualization

'multiplot' - Adapted from http://www.cookbook-r.com/. This function plots multiple graphs in one window.
* ...: multiple plots
* cols: number of columns used to layout plots

### Functions to assist in cluster computing

'demand' - This function finds a package if not already installed locally.
* package: package name as character

'writeR' - This function saves a character string as an R script.
* R: a character string to save as an R script
* folder: where to save the R script (default: tempdir())
* file: what to name the R script (default: paste0(basename(folder), ".R"))

'qsub' - This function sends a character string as a bash command to queue via qsub.
* command: a character string to send as a bash command
* N: equivalent to qsub -N
* M: equivalent to qsub -M
* m: equivalent to qsub -m
